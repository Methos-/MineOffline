MineOffline
===========

MineOffline is a program designed for Windows users that allows you to play Minecraft in offline mode with your own customized experience. It uses Minecraft.exe to download Minecraft files for you (after you log in with an account), and lets you use a custom username for joining servers in offline mode. The ability for custom skins (and capes!) is coming soon.

DISCLAIMER:
===========

We do not own Minecraft files, nor are we allowed to distribute Minecraft files, and do not plan to. But, for the "Log In and Download" feature to work, you must include Minecraft.exe in the same folder as MineOffline.exe. We leave you to do that yourself.
